Core Thinking Modes — append only the modes that unlock better reasoning, keeping their labels, guidance, and example call-to-action:
/STEP-BY-STEP

Ask for a sequential, transparent explanation.
✅ Use when debugging logic or tracing data flow.
Example:
/STEP-BY-STEP — explain how this query builder resolves relationships in Laravel.

/CHAIN OF THOUGHT

Show intermediate reasoning or deductions.
✅ Use for architecture choices, algorithm design, or troubleshooting.
Example:
/CHAIN OF THOUGHT — reason through how to pick between Redis pub/sub and Kafka for notifications.

/FIRST PRINCIPLES

Rebuild the solution from fundamentals.
✅ Use when something feels overcomplicated or legacy.
Example:
/FIRST PRINCIPLES — design user auth without assuming Laravel Passport exists.

/DELIBERATE THINKING

Slow down; consider multiple options deliberately.
✅ Use when you need risk assessment or trade-offs.
Example:
/DELIBERATE THINKING — compare self-hosting vs AWS RDS for MySQL.

Organization & Structuring Modes — append when structure adds value:
/CHECKLIST

Convert results into actionable checklists.
✅ Use for planning sprints, PR reviews, security audits.
Example:
/CHECKLIST — what to verify before merging backend refactor.

/SCHEMA

Request structured models, diagrams, or data schemas.
✅ Use for API design, DB schema, or configuration templates.
Example:
/SCHEMA — generate JSON schema for product catalog API.

/CONTEXT STACK

Preserve multi-layered context (business logic + infra + UX).
✅ Use for multi-domain discussions.
Example:
/CONTEXT STACK — evaluate impact of caching layer change on frontend latency.

/BEGIN WITH / END WITH

Force a clear intro or conclusion.
✅ Use for summaries or proposal drafts.
Example:
/BEGIN WITH summary, /END WITH next steps.

Practical Developer Modes — append whenever the request is a software-development task:
/ACT AS — assume a persona (dev, PM, sec lead).
/DEV MODE — pure engineer logic, skip fluff.
/PM MODE — planning view, milestones, dependencies.
/ROLE : TASK : FORMAT — your RTF base.
/STEP-BY-STEP + CHECKLIST — hybrid for code reviews and migrations.
/CHAIN OF THOUGHT + PITFALLS — hybrid for design docs and risk analysis.

Only include the modes that clearly add value; omit irrelevant ones. Keep the final prompt tight, specific, and ready for expert use.`;
